WorldViz's Vizard 6 VR software now officially supports Pupil Labs eye tracker! Just snap on Pupil Labs vr-ar add-on to your VR headset and you are ready to go.

By integrating eye tracker with Vizard 6, you are able to quickly add eye tracking to your virtual scene. Eye tracking adds another level of immersion and control in VR, as another alternate input which can provide whole new ways to interact in the virtual world. Instead of using controllers, just simply look and interact with objects. Also perform gaze analysis, record and exporting of your data.
