We are really pleased to have discovered [Marc-Oliver Gern's](https://medium.com/@hellomarcoliver) article, ["Adding mobile eye-tracking to your usability studies. A step-by-step guide"](https://medium.com/the-versatile-designer/adding-mobile-eye-tracking-to-your-usability-studies-a-step-by-step-guide-4ba161cb3a74) and wanted to share it widely with the Pupil Community!


The article is well written and a pleasure to read for a wide audience (technical and non-technical). The article presents a concise introduction to eye tracking along with key concepts, and then dives into lots of concrete examples that demonstrate how to use Pupil for usability research on desktop and mobile devices. 

If you're just stumbling on Pupil, are new to Pupil, or are already a Pupil user considering Pupil for UI/UX studies, we would highly recommend reading through the entire article. 

Keep up the great work Marc-Oliver!
