The article provides an insight on how eye tracking was mostly associated with university research labs which makes it a very niche market. In part due to expensive cost of purchusing eye tracking hardware and software but also that it hasn't found a place in the consumer market yet. And now where more efficient fabrication and prototyping tools with smaller and cheaper components is pushing eye tracking to become more of a mainstream technology.

Here is an excerpt from the arcticle:
<blockquote cite="http://">
"...With no funding whatsoever,
they began disassembling off-the-shelf webcams and
making prototype eye trackers with 3-D printers. Now,
with parts from Chinese suppliers, Pupil Labs assembles
its products out of a small office in Berlin and sells them
to university researchers, along with its open source
software, for a few thousand dollars..." (p 3)

With virtual and augmented reality becoming a mainstream technology with consumer products in the market. This allows for more development for eye tracking applications in virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) head mounted displays (HMDs).

Pupil's commitment is making accessible and open eye tracking tools.
<blockquote cite="http://">
...While other tools/frameworks may already exist for eye tracking in HMDs, the majority of the code remains closed – a blackbox – inhibiting those who want to learn more or make their own tools. This is why we propose a community driven, open source suite of software  **building blocks for eye tracking HMDs.**
