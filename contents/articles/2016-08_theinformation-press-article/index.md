Pupil is featured in The Information article "Eye-Tracking Companies Set Sights on VR", August, 2016. (Note - full article is behind a paywall).

The article highlights VR as an inevitable and promising consumer application area for eye tracking and provides an overview of the technological impact and players in the field. In part due to expensive cost of purchusing eye tracking hardware and software but also that it hasn't found a place in the consumer market yet. And now where more efficient fabrication and prototyping tools with smaller and cheaper components is pushing eye tracking to become more of a mainstream technology.

Pupil's commitment is making accessible and open eye tracking tools.

<blockquote cite="http://">
...While other tools/frameworks may already exist for eye tracking in HMDs, the majority of the code remains closed – a blackbox – inhibiting those who want to learn more or make their own tools. This is why we propose a community driven, open source suite of software  **building blocks for eye tracking HMDs.**
</blockquote>

We would be excited to see consumer-ware VR/AR/MR devices with built-in eye tracking technology. But, what the article fails to address are critical issues of accessibility, transparency, and privacy.

Will researchers and developers be able to access and introspect into fundamental algorithms or will it be a proprietary black box? Will researchers and developers be allowed to modify and extend the consumer-ware platforms at the lowest levels or will they be restricted by the limits of a SDK? Will the consumer-ware hardware be suitable for the diverse fields of research and development? If eye movement data is captured and saved by consumer-ware distributors – will such data be secure and/or will this potential data cache be accessible to researchers?

While all of these questions are open speculation until we see something concrete from the consumer-ware VR/AR/MR.

We at Pupil Labs would like to reinforce our commitment to building accessible and open tools for eye tracking. We write about our goals in [this blog post](https://pupil-labs.com/blog/2016-04/eye-tracking-head-mounted-displays/)
